As we've journeyed through this book together, we've delved into not only the technical aspects of Flutter development, 
but also its conceptual and practical sides. This journey was about acting on our curiosity and creating meaningful 
software. Here is our outcome:

\begin{itemize}
\item \q{Fingrom} -- open-source financial accounting application.\\

\item \q{Dart Class Wrapper} -- for a partial mocking of classes.\\
\href{https://github.com/lyskouski/dart\_class\_wrapper}{https://github.com/lyskouski/dart\_class\_wrapper}

\item \q{Gherkin Widget Tests} -- to execute tests with Cucumber notation.\\
