\noindent The purpose of this book is not merely to instruct, but rather to embark on a shared journey into the realm of 
platform-agnostic application development using Flutter. I started this book knowing nothing about Flutter or Dart. The 
time I've spent studying them has given me an initial understanding, and I still have something to share with you. 

\vspace{3mm}

\noindent I am confident that approximately 200 hours of coding is sufficient to grasp the fundamental concepts of any 
programming language or framework, regardless of your background, as long as you progressively tackle more complex tasks 
and gradually reduce your need for assistance.

\vspace{3mm}

\noindent Over the past 20 years, I've diligently followed a day-to-day approach to learning that has become a habit. I 
am technically proficient and have a profound customer focus and business acumen. I possess insights into product, 
project, and software life cycles.

\vspace{3mm}

\noindent I warmly invite you to join me as we explore Flutter throughout this book. Together, we will explore Flutter's 
extensive capabilities. This collaborative learning journey promises to be exciting and enriching as we delve deeper 
into this versatile framework.
