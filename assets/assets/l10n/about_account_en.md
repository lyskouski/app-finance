## Accounts

On the next page, it will be shown a form to create an account. 
After the introductory steps, it would be possible to create as many accounts as needed, but let's start with the first one. 

There are several types of accounts:
- **Bank Account**: _this account stores funds held with a financial institution and is used for everyday transactions. 
  Use it if no cards linked._
- **Cash**: _represents physical currency that the business or individual has on hand and is typically used for smaller, 
  immediate expenses._
- **Debit Card**: _linked directly to a bank account, this account type allows for electronic payments and withdrawals, 
  immediately deducting funds from the available balance._
- **Credit Card**: _a credit account that allows purchases or withdrawals to be made on borrowed funds, which must be 
  repaid later._
- **Deposit**: _an account where funds are placed for safekeeping, often earning interest over time, such as in savings 
  accounts or fixed deposits._
- **Credit**: _refers to an account that tracks borrowed money, such as loans or lines of credit, and keeps a record of 
  amounts owed to creditors._
