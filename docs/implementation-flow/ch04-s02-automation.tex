\subsection{Automating Conditions}
\markboth{Gating}{Automating Conditions}

Writing tests is not enough without defined and automated continuous integration. To achieve robust quality checks, we 
need to implement automation that gradually eliminates the need for manual intervention. Furthermore, Flutter provides 
commands to check the code itself:

\begin{itemize}
  \item flutter analyze -- static analysis;
  \item dart format -- apply rules from \q{analysis\_options.yaml}, described on the page
  \href{https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style\#formatting}{https://dart.dev/effective-dart/style\#formatting};
  \item dart fix -- check points of an improvement and optimization.
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Creating Git Hooks}

Some might think additional checks before \q{git commit} or \q{git push} would slow down the development process. 
Contrary to that, it minimizes back-and-forth pushes to resolve failures in the CI/CD build procedure. For large 
projects, this process might take hours, as opposed to seconds in a local environment. Of course, the automation process 
must be carried out accurately and diligently; otherwise, it will be a constant source of frustration.

Implementation of git hooks is mostly a preparation of \q{bash}-scripts for execution, so, let's discuss here
\q{pre-push}-file (since \q{pre-commit}-file contains almost the same logic for another scope of commands). As an
additional valuable tip, those files have to have "LF" end of line sequence otherwise won't be recognized by the system
(Linux, Macos).

\begin{lstlisting}[language=terminal]
#!/bin/bash
status=0
# Trigger tests
flutter test
# Take an exit code from lastly executed command
status_test=$?
# Verify command results
if [ $status_test -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "[x] flutter test - failed."
  status=1
else
  echo "[+] flutter test - passed."
fi
# Other than zero means a failure
exit $status
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent And we'll use Grinder (\ref{a-grinder}) to install our hooks:

\begin{lstlisting}
// ./tool/grind.dart
import 'package:path/path.dart' as path;

main(args) => grind(args);

@Task('Install Git Hooks')
installGitHooks() {
  final currDir = Directory('./');
  final hookDir = Directory('./.git/hooks');
  final hookNames = ['pre-commit', 'pre-push'];
  for (final name in hookNames) {
    log('Applying: $name');
    final sourceFile = File(path.join(currDir.absolute.path, name));
    sourceFile.copySync(path.join(hookDir.absolute.path, name));
    if (!Platform.isWindows) {
      Process.runSync('chmod', ['ug+x', './.git/hooks/$name']);
    }
  }
  log('Git Hooks applied!');
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent After that, by using a command line, we may check what's been done:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=terminal]
$ dart run grinder -h
Dart workflows, automated.

Usage: grinder [options] [<tasks>...]

Global options:
  --no-color           Whether to use terminal colors.
  --version            Reports the version of this tool.
  -h, --help           Print this usage information.

Available tasks:
  install-git-hooks    Install Git Hooks

$ dart run grinder install-git-hooks
  grinder running install-git-hooks

  install-git-hooks
    Applying: pre-commit

$ git push
# ... logs from tests
[+] flutter test - passed.
# ... other logs from git
\end{lstlisting}


\subsubsection{Adding Grinder Tasks} \label{a-grinder}

Grinder is a task runner for Dart, helping to define and automate common project workflows, as said on its main page
\href{https://pub.dev/packages/grinder}{https://pub.dev/packages/grinder}.  It can be either added via \q{flutter pub
add grinder --dev}-command, or by editing \q{pubspec.yaml}-file  (and IDE will install the dependency automatically):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml]
## ./pubspec.yaml
dev_dependencies:
  grinder: ^0.9.4
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent In addition, grinder package can be made globally available by using \q{dart pub global activate grinder}-command.
To generate a skeleton of the tasks' code structure (if missing) follow \q{dart run grinder:init}, and to view all of 
the tasks -- \q{dart run grinder -h}.

As one of the project workflow automation it can be mentioned a localization task
(\href{https://docs.flutter.dev/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization}{https://docs.flutter.dev/accessibility-and-localization/internationalization}).
Just to recap, in Flutter it's used Application Resource Bundle(s) (\q{.arb}-files) for internationalizing apps.
So, not to create a mess in those files, it's better to have an automation to rearrange our labels alphabetically
(in \q{/lib/l10n/app\_*.arb}-files). Lately, the automation can be also extended by checking consistency (enter missing
labels across the \q{.arb}-files), exporting labels to \q{.scv}-file for a simplification of a translation process, and
importing them from \q{.scv}-file back to \q{.arb}-files \issue{283}{}.

\begin{lstlisting}
// ./tool/grind.dart
import './localization.dart' as locale;

@Task('Update Translations by sorting values alphabetically')
sortTranslations() {
  // Get all additional arguments for the command
  TaskArgs args = context.invocation.arguments;
  // Run: dart run grinder sort-translations --quiet
  bool isQuiet = args.getFlag('quiet'); // Returns 'true' if set
  bool isChanged = locale.sortArbKeys('./lib/l10n');
  if (isChanged && !isQuiet) {
    fail('Changes detected'); // (!) to handle failure
  }(*@ \stopnumber @*)
}

// ./tool/localization.dart
bool sortArbKeys(String path) {
  log('Checking $path'); // Add to console output the text
  final arbDir = Directory(path);
  bool isChanged = false;
  // Check, that folder is not missing
  if (!arbDir.existsSync()) {
    log('Error: Directory not found');
    return true;
  }
  // Loop per each file there
  for (var file in arbDir.listSync()) {
    // Take only .arb-files
    if (file is File && file.path.endsWith('.arb')) {
      log('- ${file.path}');
      // '|=' is a boolean OR assignment
      isChanged |= sortArbFileKeys(file);
    }
  }
  log(isChanged ? 'Labels reordered' : 'Nothing was changed');
  return isChanged;
}

bool sortArbFileKeys(File file) {
  // Load data from file
  final jsonContent = file.readAsStringSync();
  final arbMap = json.decode(jsonContent) as Map<String, dynamic>;
  // Sort labels
  final entries = arbMap.entries.toList();
  entries.sort((a, b) {
    // '@key' should go after 'key'
    final aKey = a.key.startsWith('@') ? a.key.substring(1) : a.key;
    final bKey = b.key.startsWith('@') ? b.key.substring(1) : b.key;
    if (aKey == bKey) {
      if (a.key.startsWith('@')) { return 1; }
      if (b.key.startsWith('@')) { return -1; }
    }
    return aKey.compareTo(bKey);
  });
  final sortedArbMap = Map.fromEntries(entries);

  // Write back to the file with preserved indentation
  const encoder = JsonEncoder.withIndent('    ');
  var jsonOutputContent = encoder.convert(sortedArbMap);
  file.writeAsStringSync(jsonOutputContent);
  return jsonOutputContent != jsonContent; // Check if changed
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Grinder tasks can be also made a part of IDE short-commands (VS Code sample, \cref{img:vsc-task}):

\img{prototyping/vscode-automation}{Custom task visual representation in VS Code}{img:vsc-task}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
# ./.vscode/tasks.json
{
  "version": "2.0.0",
  "tasks": [
    {
      "label": "Generate Mocks",
      "command": "dart",
      "args": ["run", "grinder", "mock"],
      "options": {
        "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}"
      },
      "type": "shell"
    }
  ]
}
\end{lstlisting}
\newpage
\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
# ./.vscode/launch.json
{
  "version": "0.2.0",
  "configurations": [
    {
      "name": "Grinder",
      "request": "launch",
      "type": "dart",
      "codeLens": {
        "for": ["run-test", "run-test-file"]
      },
      "preLaunchTask": "Generate Mocks"
    }
  ]
}
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Alternatively, we may use \q{flutter run build\_runner watch}, which will track changes and automatically 
rebuild generated files as needed.


\subsubsection{Running GitHub Workflows}

Now that our local automation is in place, it's time to take the next step: establishing quality gates for our GitHub 
repository. This involves setting up a GitHub Workflow that will be triggered on every pull request and push to the main 
branch.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml]
## ./.github/workflows/dart.yml
name: Flutter/Dart Quality Gates
# Criteria for taking action
on:
  push: # Trigger after a merge
    branches: [ "main" ] # limit to main-branch
  pull_request: # Trigger on pull-request
    branches: [ "main" ] # if the target is main-branch

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest # Environment for execution

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3 # Checkout from repository
      - uses: subosito/flutter-action@v2 # Install Flutter/Dart
        with:
          channel: 'stable'
      - run: flutter --version # Show version in logs

      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: flutter pub get

      - name: Verify Formatting
        run: dart format --output=none --set-exit-if-changed .
      - name: Check Localizations ordering
        run: dart run grinder sort-translations

# Disabled by having too many failures by now ))
#      # Consider passing '--fatal-infos' to be strict
#      - name: Analyze Project Source
#        run: flutter analyze

      - name: Run tests
        run: flutter test

      - name: Store Tests Artifacts
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: testing_logs
          path: coverage
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent By preparing a pull-request we would see next representative validations flow
(\cref{img:pt-github}, \cref{img:pt-github-details})):

\img{prototyping/github-check}{GitHub Toolbar on pull-request}{img:pt-github}

\img{prototyping/github-check-details}{GitHub Workflow Actions details}{img:pt-github-details}


\subsubsection{Commending with Badges} \label{a-badges}

One way to improve the current state is to acknowledge and appreciate our efforts with Badges of Workflow Status and 
Code Coverage. These badges demonstrate our commitment to quality and efficiency, motivating us to continually improve 
and reach new heights.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=terminal]
## ./README.md
# Notation of an image with tooltip "Build Status"
![Build Status](https://github.com/{user}/{repo}/actions/workflows/{workflow-name}.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)
# Notation of an image with a link to our repository
![Tests Coverage](https://{user}.github.io/{repo}/coverage_badge.svg)](https://github.com/{user}/{repo})
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent \q{Build Status} is supported out of the box (OOTB) by GitHub, just it's needed to replace \q{\{user\}} 
(by account name on GitHub), \q{\{repo\}} (repository name), and \q{\{workflow-name\}} (name of the file in 
\q{.github/workflows}-folder).

\q{Test Coverage} is needed to be cooked (there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution), and we would start from creating 
\q{gh-pages} in our repository (drop hooks from \q{.git/hooks}-folder if they've been enabled):

\begin{lstlisting}[language=terminal]
$ git switch --orphan gh-pages
$ git commit --allow-empty -m "Initial commit"
$ git push -u origin gh-pages
$ git checkout main
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent That will create for us a special branch that is accessible via \q{https://\{user\}.github.io/\{repo\}}-link.
Then we need to extend our GitHub Workflow by adding a section with uploading artifacts:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml]
## ./.github/workflows/dart.yml
# Updating previously created step by a conditional execution
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    if [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/main" ]]; then
        flutter test --coverage
        dart run grinder coverage-badge # New Grinder task to generate '.svg'-file with coverage
    else
        flutter test
    fi
# New section to upload artifacts
- name: Update Coverage Badge
  # Get default branch variable and compare with current
  if: github.ref == format('refs/heads/{0}', github.event.repository.default_branch)
  uses: peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3 # Special action to upload artifacts
  with:
    github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }} # Generated automatically by GitHub
    publish_dir: ./coverage # Folder to upload
\end{lstlisting}

\img{prototyping/badges}{Generated README.md for the repository}{img:pt-badge}

\noindent Everything is done (\cref{img:pt-badge})... almost. Coverage 46\% is unbelievable for written tests. The 
problem is that untouched (by tests) files are not included into the report. And, additionally, widget tests cover 
most of the files without checking them. 

We have to separate type of tests' execution, and provide additional Grinder task to touch all our files for the 
coverage report:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=yaml]
## ./.github/workflows/dart.yml
- name: Run tests
  run: |
    if [[ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/main" ]]; then
      dart run grinder full-coverage
      flutter test --coverage test/unit
      flutter test test/widget
      dart run grinder coverage-badge
    else
      flutter test
    fi
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
// ./tool/coverage.dart
import 'dart:io';
void scanDirectory(Directory directory, List<String> files) {
  directory.listSync(recursive: true).forEach((entity) {
    if (entity is File && // Check that it's a file
        entity.path.endsWith('.dart') && // Include only Dart
        !entity.path.endsWith('.g.dart')) { // Code generation
      files.add(entity.absolute.path
        .replaceAll(root.absolute.path, '') // Cut out root prefix
        .replaceAll('\\', '/')); // Fix for Windows' systems
    } else if (entity is Directory) {
      scanDirectory(entity, files); // Recursively scan further
    }
  });
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
// ./tool/grind.dart
import './coverage.dart' as coverage;
@Task('Generate file with all lib/**.dart-files included')
fullCoverage() {
  List<String> files = [];
  String content = "// AUTOGENERATED BY 'dart run grinder full-coverage' \n";
  final rootFolder = Directory('${Directory.current.path}/lib');
  coverage.scanDirectory(rootFolder, rootFolder, files);
  for (var file in files) {
    content += "import 'package:app_finance$file';\n";
  }
  content += "void main() {}\n";
  File(path.join(Directory.current.path, 'test/_coverage.dart')).writeAsStringSync(content);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[language=terminal]
## .gitignore
# Coverage report
coverage/
test/_coverage.dart
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent 10\% Coverage... here we are. We should always keep in mind (exists term \q{quality-first mindset}, \cite{Bjorn21})
that tests are a significant investment into the whole application quality and to speed-up the implementation cycles
(by skipping a manual verification, and preventing regressions). Consequences of their ignorance would be described
later (\ref{ut-fail}).
