\subsection{Handling Instabilities}
\markboth{Optimizing}{Handling Instabilities}

A rich interface may road us to an area of instabilities...\\
\\

\noindent By example, an error \emph{"Scaffold.geometryOf() must only be accessed during the paint phase"} (with ongoing 
\emph{"'package:flutter/src/rendering/mouse\_tracker.dart': Failed assertion: ... '!\_debugDuringDeviceUpdate': 
is not true"}) leads to a fully nonfunctional state  of the application (by not responding to any of interaction).
Sometimes we might be not alone with the problematic area; as for the error above, it's been highlighted to Flutter 
SDK team a few times (issues \href{https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/76325}{\#76325},
\href{https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/108363}{\#108363}, 
\href{https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/126513}{\#126513}, ...), but closed without being resolved simply by 
not declared steps to reproduce it constantly.

\img{uiux/bottom-bar}{Application Bottom Bar for small screens}{img:u-bottom-bar}

\noindent In our case (see \cref{img:u-bottom-bar}), the problem occurs when using 
\q{FloatingActionButtonLocation.centerDocked} with a \q{bottomNavigationBar} for \q{Scaffold}. The problem appears when 
navigating back and forth between pages. This issue relates to how Flutter renders under the hood, and there are no 
steps declared to resolve it. Each time, a unique approach may be required:

\begin{lstlisting}
// Awaiting for the route transition to be completed
await route.completed;

// Deactivate inactive routes to be remained in memory
MaterialPageRoute(maintainState: false, ... 
      // or contrary, has to be "true"

// Wrap lists content and declare scrolling
ListView.builder(
  scrollDirection: Axis.vertical,
  shrinkWrap: true,
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent Sometimes the problem cannot be resolved in the application itself, and we have to change somehow used 
external components. We may either create an issue 
(\href{https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/134408}{https://github.com/flutter/flutter/issues/134408}) 
with an assumption that it will be taken into account and fixed sometime, or create a patch by our own 
(\href{https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/134409}{https://github.com/flutter/flutter/pull/134409}). In cases, when 
the fix is not universal (or we do not have a time for) and relevant only for us, external component should be forked 
(\href{https://github.com/lyskouski/flutter}{https://github.com/lyskouski/flutter}) and re-targeted for the application
via \q{pubspec.yaml}, or, in case of Flutter itself, by a local binding (as for Linux -- 
\href{https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux#install-flutter-manually}{https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/linux\#install-flutter-manually}).\\
\\

\noindent The main idea is to not let the problem take its course. Neither users nor superiors would care if the problem 
falls outside the scope of our application or responsibilities. With our full assistance every step of the way, the 
provided impetus must reach the target.
