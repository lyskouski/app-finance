\subsection{Activating Sponsorship}
\markboth{Prototyping}{Activating Sponsorship}

It might be thought that we're going to use a Freemium business model (portmanteau of "free" and "premium"), which 
combines free basic features with paid access to premium functionality. However, this is not possible because we have 
open sourced the solution. If any limitations appear, the application might be forked and "lost" to us. Nevertheless, 
monetization is essential because as we attract more users, the application requires more attention and resources.

The subscription is not just about making money. It's about sustaining the costs of development, maintenance, and 
support, while also growing and delivering value to our users. It enables us to keep pace with our competitors and 
invest in innovation.

This is where donation-based crowdfunding comes into play. It involves collecting small sums of money from a large 
number of people. Unlike other types of crowdfunding, such as equity- or reward-based crowdfunding, this method does not 
promise backers financial returns or specific rewards. Rather, people contribute to the project out of goodwill and a 
desire to support our ideas and objectives. This method allows us to raise funds from individuals who genuinely resonate 
with our product vision.


\subsubsection{Adding Custom References}

For Windows, Linux, and Web releases the simplest way of adding a subscription would be to provide links to external 
services, that're specialized on crowdfunding initiatives:

\begin{itemize}
  \item  \href{https://github.com/sponsors}{https://github.com/sponsors}
  \item  \href{https://patreon.com}{https://patreon.com}
  \item  \href{https://donorbox.org}{https://donorbox.org}
  \item  \href{https://paypal.me}{https://paypal.me}
  \item  and many others...
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\img{first-steps/subscription-links}{List of external subscriptions}{img:fs-links}

\noindent Implementation of external links \issue{20}{} is possible by \q{url\_launcher}-package (\cref{img:fs-links}):

\begin{lstlisting}
import 'package:url_launcher/url_launcher.dart';

class OtherWidget extends StatelessWidget {
  const OtherWidget({super.key});

  Future<void> _launchURL(String url) =>
    launchUrl(Uri.parse(url), mode: LaunchMode.externalApplication);

  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return ElevatedButton(
      onPressed: () => _launchURL(
          'https://buymeacoffee.com/lyskouski'),
      child: Text('Buy me a coffee'),
    ),
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Enabling Purchases}

In-app purchases are required for mobile app stores since it cannot be used any third-party systems to handle payments
by the terms and conditions of marketplaces. As, to work with Google and Apple subscriptions we need to be registered 
there as a trusted developers / companies. Google Play Developer account 
(\href{https://play.google.com/console}{https://play.google.com/console}; set up and create a subscription product in 
the "Store Presence" section) would costs us 25 Euro at once, Apple Store Developer account 
(\href{https://developer.apple.com}{https://developer.apple.com}; via Apple Developer account create App ID and 
configure the in-app purchase settings) -- roughly 100 Euro per year. Don't forget about other marketplaces as 
Galaxy and Huawei Store.

There would be a couple of steps to verify our identity, add bank account, sign documents (tax forms) and agreements.
As an example, for Apple Store:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Activate paid apps on page:\\
  \href{https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/agreements}{https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/agreements}
  \item Register Bundle ID:\\
  \href{https://developer.apple.com/account/resources/identifiers/bundleId/add/bundle}{https://developer.apple.com/.../add/bundle}
  \item Fulfill app definition:\\
  \href{https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps}{https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/apps}
  \item Via "Features" $\rightarrow$ "In-App Purchases" [Create] and "Subscriptions" [Create] declare costs
\end{enumerate}

\noindent As a remark, we might enroll "Small-Business Support" to minimize marketplace deductions:
\href{https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/enroll/}{https://developer.apple.com/app-store/small-business-program/enroll/}.

In-app purchases are classified based on their usage: consumables (can be used multiple times), non-consumables 
(one-time use), and subscriptions (recurring payments). And three different ways to integrate them into Flutter 
application: \q{in\_app\_purchase}, \q{flutter\_inapp\_purchase}, \q{purchases\_flutter}. 

As for the first one, the CodeLabs provides a step-by-step manual in details:
\href{https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-in-app-purchases}{https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/flutter-in-app-purchases}.

\img{first-steps/subscription}{Apple TestFlight -- Subscription check \issue{100}{}}{img:fs-subscription}

\noindent The potential downside of using the \q{in\_app\_purchase}-package is that it might result in build failures 
for \q{macOS}. This could occur due to the requirement for a minimum macOS version of 10.15 for deployment:

\newpage
\begin{lstlisting}
// ./macos/Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj
\end{lstlisting}
{
\xpretocmd{\lstlisting}{\vspace{-12pt}}{}{}
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=2, backgroundcolor=\color{backred}]
(*@\kdiff{-}@*)   MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = <any other version>;
\end{lstlisting}
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=2, backgroundcolor=\color{backgreen}]
(*@\kdiff{+}@*)   MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET = 10.15;
\end{lstlisting}
}

\noindent And, it still won't work without \q{./macos/Podfile}-file defined, hopefully with a universal content 
\issue{100}{05329b3}.

However, it's not enough to just add the package and subscription functionality. Each of items must be explicitly 
specified in the configuration file per each environment (iOS, macOS, and Android). Otherwise, the app will be rejected 
at the validation stage:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=terminal]
App Store Connect App Review 
Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness
  We are unable to complete the review of your app because one 
  or more of your in-app purchase products have not been 
  submitted for review.
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent For iOS/macOS, by using Xcode's Capabilities panel, turn on In-App Purchases, and select the IDs we want to 
use. This creates the \q{Runner/Release.entitlements}-file:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=xml]
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
    <key>com.apple.developer.in-app-purchase</key>
    <true/>
</dict>
</plist>  
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent And, the \q{Runner/Info.plist}-file is adjusted by new lines:

\begin{lstlisting}[language=xml]
<key>SKAdNetworkItems</key>
<array>
  <dict>
    <key>SKAdNetworkIdentifier</key>
    <string>com.example.adnetwork1</string>
  </dict>
</array>
<key>SKStoreProductParameterOfferID</key>
<string>com.tercad.fingrom.{purchase ID}</string>
\end{lstlisting}

\noindent As a note, the \q{.entitlements}-file has to be mentioned in the build settings, 
\q{Runner.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj}-file:

\begin{lstlisting}
buildSettings = {
\end{lstlisting}
{
\xpretocmd{\lstlisting}{\vspace{-12pt}}{}{}
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=20, backgroundcolor=\color{backgreen}]
(*@\kdiff{+}@*)	CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS = Runner/Release.entitlements;
\end{lstlisting}
}

~

\noindent As for Android, the change in the \q{android/app/build.gradle} would be:

\begin{lstlisting}
release {
  signingConfig signingConfigs.release
\end{lstlisting}
{
\xpretocmd{\lstlisting}{\vspace{-12pt}}{}{}
\begin{lstlisting}[firstnumber=2, backgroundcolor=\color{backgreen}]
(*@\kdiff{+}@*)  resValue "string", "play_billing_key", '{Billing Key}'
(*@\kdiff{+}@*)  resValue "string", "play_billing_key_public", '{Billing Public Key}'
\end{lstlisting}
}
