## Budget Categories

On the next page, it will be shown a form to create a budget category. 
After the introductory steps, it would be possible to create as many categories as needed, but let's start with 
the first one. 

Budget categories are specific areas where money is allocated to track expenses effectively. By organizing spending into 
categories, individuals or businesses can manage finances, control costs, and ensure they are staying on track with 
financial goals.

**"Limit per month"** is a valuable asset for categorization. It can be of three types depending on the value entered:
- 0 (zero) -- no limit is set, just spending is recorded.
- between 0.0 an 1.0 -- the percentage of spending relative to the profit earned that month.
- greater than 1 -- a fixed amount of the limit.

Hereâ€™s examples of common budget categories:
- Housing (Rent/Mortgage, Utilities, Repairs/Maintenance)
- Food (Groceries, Dining Out)
- Transportation (Fuel, Public Transportation, Vehicle Maintenance)
- Health & Insurance (Health Insurance, Medical Expenses, Life Insurance)
- Entertainment & Recreation (Subscriptions, Hobbies, Vacations)
- Personal Care (Clothing, Health & Beauty)
- Education (Tuition, Books/Supplies, Courses/Training)
- Unexpected Expenses
etc.
